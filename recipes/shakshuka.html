    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      If you are not familiar with shakshuka, I am thrilled to introduce the
      concept to you! Shakshuka is a North African dish that is now popular
      throughout the Middle East.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>
        4 cups ripe diced tomatoes, or 2 cans (14 oz. each) diced tomatoes
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon mild chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
      <li>Pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)</li>
      <li>kosher salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>
        1/2 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley or cilantro (optional, for garnish)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instruction</h3>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <li>
          Heat a deep, large skillet or sauté pan on medium. Slowly warm olive
          oil in the pan. Add chopped onion, sauté for a few minutes until the
          onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to sauté till mixture
          is fragrant.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Add the diced bell pepper, sauté for 5-7 minutes over medium until
          softened.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir until blended. Add spices
          and sugar, stir, and allow mixture to simmer over medium heat for 5-7
          minutes until it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the
          mixture and spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and
          pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more cayenne
          pepper for a spicier shakshuka.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture,
          making sure to space them evenly over the sauce. I usually place 5
          eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook
          "over easy" style on top of the tomato sauce.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Cover the pan with a lid. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes,
          or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has slightly reduced. Keep
          an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too
          much, which can lead to burning.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Some people prefer their shakshuka with more runny yolks. If this is
          your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few minutes before
          cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to
          taste, making sure the egg whites are set before serving. Garnish with
          the chopped parsley or cilantro, if desired. A sprinkle of feta cheese
          on top is also nice!
